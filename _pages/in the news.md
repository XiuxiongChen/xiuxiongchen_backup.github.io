- ## Professor Xiuxiong Chen Awarded 2019 Oswald Veblen Prize
  Chen, Donaldson, and Sun announced a complete solution of the conjecture for Fano manifolds in International Mathematics Research Notices in 2014, and full proofs followed in Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds. I: Approximation of metrics with cone singularities, Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds. II: Limits with cone angle less than $2\pi$, and Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds. III: Limits as cone angle approaches $2\pi$ and completion of the main proof, all published in 2015 in the Journal of the AMS.

  As one nominator put it, This is perhaps the biggest breakthrough in differential geometry since Perelman’s work on the Poincaré conjecture. It is certainly the biggest result in Kähler geometry since Yau’s solution of the Calabi conjecture 35 years earlier. It is already having a huge impact that will only grow with time.

- ## Professor Xiuxiong Chen Named 2019 Simons Investigator
  Professor Chen works in the field of differential geometry which investigates relations among various structures on shaped spaces. The world that we are experiencing is of three dimensional and is called the Euclidean space. On this space, there is an algebraic structure which allows us to combine two forces; a geometric structure which allows us to quantify the curvedness of a surface, also known as curvature; and its topological structure is used to distinguish a sphere from a torus. The similar, if more complicated, structures also exist on higher dimensional spaces of a more general nature. Although we cannot visualize these spaces, called manifolds, we can study them and analyze the relations among various structures on them with advanced mathematics. Professor Chen addresses these challenging questions and has transformed our understanding of these manifolds.

  Simons Investigators receive one hundred thousand dollars per year from the foundation, enabling them to undertake the long-term study of fundamental questions.  As with the MacArthur Foundation “genius awards,” the awardees are unaware ahead of time of their being considered for the award and the prize money comes with no strings attached. A Simons Investigator is appointed for an initial period of five years, with renewal for an additional five years, contingent upon evaluation of the Investigator’s scientific impact. 

  The Simons Foundation supports fundamental research through several funding programs. Each year since 2012, the Simons Foundation awards three to four outstanding mathematicians in their most productive years, when they are establishing creative new research directions, providing leadership to the field and effectively mentoring junior scientists. Of the 33 recipients so far, four have received the Breakthrough Prize, six are Fields medalists and three the MacArthur fellows.  

  The award citation recognizes Professor Xiuxiong Chen as a leading figure in complex geometry with fundamental contributions to the field.  He and his collaborators have made major breakthroughs and finally settled several long-standing problems.  With S. K. Donaldson and S. Sun, Chen proved the stability conjecture (which goes back to Yau) on Fano Kaehler manifolds.  With B. Wang, Chen confirmed the Hamilton-Tian conjecture on the Kaehler-Rcci flow on Fano manifolds. With J.R. Cheng, Chen found a groundbreaking a priori estimate for Kaehler metrics, under assumptions on the scalar curvature, which involved a fourth-order differential equation, and  verified the fundamental Donaldson geodesic stability conjecture and the properness conjecture.

- ## The Achievement Was Selected as One of the Top 10 Domestic Science and Technology News in China (2020)
  Sponsored by Science and Technology Daily, the Top Ten Domestic and International Science and Technology News Stories of 2020—selected jointly by a panel of academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, together with media professionals—were officially announced on December 27, 2020.

  Two achievements from our university were selected among the Top Ten Domestic Science and Technology News of 2020: the work by Professor Xiuxiong Chen’s team, titled “Two Core Conjectures in Differential Geometry Proven After More Than 20 Years”, and the achievement by Academician JianWei Pan’s team, “The Debut of the ‘Jiuzhang’ Quantum Computer Draws Worldwide Attention”.

  Professors Xiuxiong Chen and Bing Wang were the first to resolve the Hamilton–Tian Conjecture and the Partial C0-conjecture, two central open problems in geometric analysis that had remained unsolved for more than two decades. Their research results were published in the Journal of Differential Geometry. This work introduced a number of new ideas and methods, and has already had a profound impact on the study of geometric analysis, particularly on Ricci flow.
