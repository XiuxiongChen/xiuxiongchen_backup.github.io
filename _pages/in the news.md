- ## Professor Xiuxiong Chen Awarded 2019 Oswald Veblen Prize
  Chen, Donaldson, and Sun announced a complete solution of the conjecture for Fano manifolds in International Mathematics Research Notices in 2014, and full proofs followed in Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds. I: Approximation of metrics with cone singularities, Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds. II: Limits with cone angle less than $2\pi$, and Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds. III: Limits as cone angle approaches $2\pi$ and completion of the main proof, all published in 2015 in the Journal of the AMS.

  As one nominator put it, This is perhaps the biggest breakthrough in differential geometry since Perelman’s work on the Poincaré conjecture. It is certainly the biggest result in Kähler geometry since Yau’s solution of the Calabi conjecture 35 years earlier. It is already having a huge impact that will only grow with time.

- ## Professor Xiuxiong Chen Named 2019 Simons Investigator
  Professor Chen works in the field of differential geometry which investigates relations among various structures on shaped spaces. The world that we are experiencing is of three dimensional and is called the Euclidean space. On this space, there is an algebraic structure which allows us to combine two forces; a geometric structure which allows us to quantify the curvedness of a surface, also known as curvature; and its topological structure is used to distinguish a sphere from a torus. The similar, if more complicated, structures also exist on higher dimensional spaces of a more general nature. Although we cannot visualize these spaces, called manifolds, we can study them and analyze the relations among various structures on them with advanced mathematics. Professor Chen addresses these challenging questions and has transformed our understanding of these manifolds.

  Simons Investigators receive one hundred thousand dollars per year from the foundation, enabling them to undertake the long-term study of fundamental questions.  As with the MacArthur Foundation “genius awards,” the awardees are unaware ahead of time of their being considered for the award and the prize money comes with no strings attached. A Simons Investigator is appointed for an initial period of five years, with renewal for an additional five years, contingent upon evaluation of the Investigator’s scientific impact. 

  The Simons Foundation supports fundamental research through several funding programs. Each year since 2012, the Simons Foundation awards three to four outstanding mathematicians in their most productive years, when they are establishing creative new research directions, providing leadership to the field and effectively mentoring junior scientists. Of the 33 recipients so far, four have received the Breakthrough Prize, six are Fields medalists and three the MacArthur fellows.  

  The award citation recognizes Professor Xiuxiong Chen as a leading figure in complex geometry with fundamental contributions to the field.  He and his collaborators have made major breakthroughs and finally settled several long-standing problems.  With S. K. Donaldson and S. Sun, Chen proved the stability conjecture (which goes back to Yau) on Fano Kaehler manifolds.  With B. Wang, Chen confirmed the Hamilton-Tian conjecture on the Kaehler-Rcci flow on Fano manifolds. With J.R. Cheng, Chen found a groundbreaking a priori estimate for Kaehler metrics, under assumptions on the scalar curvature, which involved a fourth-order differential equation, and  verified the fundamental Donaldson geodesic stability conjecture and the properness conjecture.

 - ## Professors Xiuxiong Chen and Bing Wang Achieve Major Breakthroughs in Ricci Flow Research
  Recently, a paper entitled “Space of Ricci Flows (II)—Part B: Weak Compactness of the Flows” by Professor Xiuxiong Chen, Founding Director of the Center for Geometry and Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, and Professor Bing Wang has been published in the internationally renowned mathematics journal, the Journal of Differential Geometry.

  In this work, Chen and Wang were the first to resolve the Hamilton–Tian Conjecture and the Partial 𝐶0-conjecture, two central open problems in geometric analysis that had remained unsolved for more than two decades. The paper exceeds 120 pages in length and underwent a six-year review and publication process from submission to final acceptance.

  The referees commented that “this paper represents a major advance in geometric analysis and will undoubtedly stimulate a great deal of related research.” Fields Medalist Simon Donaldson has also repeatedly praised the work in the media and in his writings, describing it as “one of the most significant breakthroughs in geometry in recent years.”

- ## Professor Xiuxiong Chen Achieves Milestone Results in Partial Differential Equations and Complex Geometry
  Professor Xiuxiong Chen, Director of the Institute of Geometry and Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, has achieved major milestone results in the fields of partial differential equations and complex geometry. Together with his collaborator Jingrui Cheng, he completed two papers on a priori estimates for a class of fully nonlinear fourth-order elliptic equations and on several well-known conjectures concerning Calabi extremal metrics on Kähler manifolds. These papers were successively published in the internationally renowned journal, the Journal of the American Mathematical Society.

  The papers resolved a number of famous problems related to constant scalar curvature metrics and Calabi extremal metrics on Kähler manifolds, including the long-standing Properness Conjecture and the Geodesic Stability Conjecture. These breakthroughs are expected to have a significant impact on research in both geometry and partial differential equations. Leading experts in the field have commented that this body of work “ranks among the most important results in Kähler geometry” and “will undoubtedly become a classic in both geometry and analysis.”
